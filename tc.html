Eligibility to join Omdena
<br>
In order to join Omdena, you must be over the age of 18 (with a few exceptions) and you must have an Internet connection in order to apply and work on our platform. Unfortunately, we cannot approve all applications but are proud to support a thriving community of global talent.
<br>
Regardless of where you are living, you are responsible to comply with any work authorization requirements you may have. We are not able to advise you on whether you can work on Omdena except in the specific restriction cases below.
<br>
We can also verify identity in several ways <br>
– Government ID Verification <br>
– Government ID + Residency Verification <br>
– Video Verification <br>
<br>
Finally, if you have been suspended from Omdena in the past you are not allowed to work on our platform again.
<br>
Our reason is to determine ownership of an account (including the U.S. Government Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance program) and to confirm your location to qualify for location-specific jobs. In addition, we will apply the US Government Sanction List
